# timeline-drift
Timeline Drift is a cinematic, web-based decision game that visualizes the butterfly effect—how small, seemingly harmless choices can cascade into dramatically different futures. Through branching timelines and probabilistic simulation, the game turns causality, uncertainty, and long-term impact into an interactive experience.
